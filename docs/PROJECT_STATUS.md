## M0 results (summary — verbatim detail in evidence file)

1. **Security audit**: no funded credentials in workspace; upstream install surfaces safe; m8s ships apparent live credentials (flagged, unused, uncopied).
2. **Chainstack baseline**: 38 verifier scripts discovered, **38 executed, 38 passed, runner exit 0**, isolated `uv sync --frozen` env.
3. **Dependency spike**: Gen-2 (solana-sdk 2.3.1 + litesvm 0.7 + spl-token-2022 9) **GREEN end-to-end**; Gen-4 **RED** (MSRV wall + litesvm 0.18.1 broken vs agave-4.4 lockstep). Decision: Gen-2 (ADR-0003). Toolchain updated 1.98.0 → 1.99.1 to give Gen-4 a fair trial (kept).
4. **Protocol audit** (`pump-docs` @ 639b87f): Chainstack's vendored IDLs lack the official **V3 curve trades** and **PumpSwap V2 trades** (17-account families) + multi-hop — Rust scope therefore exceeds Chainstack parity on these (G-1/G-2). Fee schedules are on-chain (`fee_config`) — no hardcoded rates. Synthetic migration + negative i128 `virtual_quote_reserves` captured with formulas and PDAs.

## M1 results (summary — verbatim detail in evidence file)

Workspace: 4 crates (core/protocols/runtime/app), solana-sdk =2.3.1 per ADR-0003, lockfile committed, rustc 1.99.1 pinned, build jobs=2. Gates all green: fmt, clippy×2 (`-D warnings`), tests×2 (8 suites each, 0 failures). CLI demonstrates offline replay/paper end-to-end (7 events → 2 dupes deduped → 5 decisions) with honest refusals for observe-streaming (M2) and live (4-gate + M7). Dual event identity, 3-tier shedding bus, crash-tolerant journal, base58 fixture serde landed.

## Open items / blockers

- None blocking M2. Watch item: host RAM — build jobs capped at 2 (held throughout M1).
- Deferred: `pump-rust-client` 0.5.0 evaluation (M3); Yellowstone bump headroom (16→17) harmless.
- Gen-4 revisit trigger documented in ADR-0003 (litesvm ≥0.19 or mollusk maturity).

## Next actions (M2 — Pump.fun event decoding + streaming parity)

1. Fixture corpus: convert chainstack committed fixtures + new sanitized captures into `fixtures/` JSONL (base58 serde landed in M1).
2. Rust decoders: pump.fun create/trade/migrate log-event parsing (TradeEvent/CompleteEvent + PostCompleteBuyEvent) and ix-data decoding (v2+v3 discriminators already tabled in sniper-protocols).
3. Provider adapters: logs (WSS logsSubscribe), blocks, Yellowstone gRPC (client 16.0.1/proto 14.0.1), SubscribeDeshred capability detection; reconnect/gap/reorder handling on the bus.
4. Differential harness: Rust decoder output vs chainstack oracle on shared fixtures (decoder-level parity report).
5. Blockhash cache + commitment upgrade wiring.
6. Gates: existing M1 gates + decoder parity table; evidence M2.md; commit.
